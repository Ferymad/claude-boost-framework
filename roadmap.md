# Claude Code Performance Enhancement Roadmap v2.0
## Implementation Guide Aligned with Official Documentation

**Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Official Features + Custom Innovations

---

## 🎯 Overview

This roadmap implements the Claude Code Performance Enhancement System using official features combined with innovative custom solutions. Each phase leverages built-in capabilities while adding enterprise-grade enhancements.

### Core Philosophy (Updated)
- **Plan First, Execute Second**: Use Plan Mode (`--permission-mode plan`) for safe exploration
- **Context as Sacred Workspace**: Monitor with `/cost` command, stay under 70%
- **Trust but Verify**: Leverage official subagents with blind validation pattern
- **Use Official Tools First**: `/hooks`, `/agents`, `/commands` for configuration

---

## 🗺️ Implementation Phases

# Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (Week 1)
*"Official Features + Core Infrastructure"*

## Objectives
✅ Initialize with official commands (`/init`, `/hooks`, `/agents`)  
✅ Set up Plan Mode workflows  
✅ Implement PROJECT_INDEX.json system (custom)  
✅ Configure enhanced memory with @imports

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1.1: Official Setup First
*Priority: CRITICAL - Foundation for all enhancements*

**What it does**: Initializes Claude Code with official features before adding custom enhancements.

**Implementation**:

1. **Initialize Project Memory (Official)**
   ```bash
   claude
   > /init
   ```
   This creates the official CLAUDE.md structure.

2. **Create Custom Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/hooks
   mkdir -p .claude/agents
   mkdir -p .claude/commands
   ```

   Create `.claude/hooks/project-indexer.py`:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   """
   Project Index Generator for Claude Code
   Creates minified abstractions of codebase for project awareness
   """

           with open("PROJECT_INDEX.json", "w") as f:
               json.dump(index, f, indent=2, default=str)
           print(f"✅ Generated PROJECT_INDEX.json ({index['stats']['total_files']} files analyzed)")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"❌ Error generating project index: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
           sys.exit(1)
   ```

2. **Make script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .claude/hooks/project-indexer.py
   ```

3. **Test the indexer**:
   ```bash
   python .claude/hooks/project-indexer.py
   ```

4. **Verify PROJECT_INDEX.json was created** and contains your project structure.

### Step 1.2: Hook Configuration (Official Method)

**What it does**: Configures automation using official `/hooks` command interface.

**Implementation**:

1. **Configure hooks via official command**:
   ```bash
   claude
   > /hooks
   ```

2. **Set up PostToolUse hook** for PROJECT_INDEX.json updates:
   - Navigate to `PostToolUse` section
   - Select `+ Add new matcher...`
   - Enter matcher: `Edit|MultiEdit|Write`
   - Select `+ Add new hook...`
   - Enter command: `python "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/project-indexer.py"`
   - Choose storage location (Project settings)

3. **IMPORTANT**: Always use `/hooks` UI, not manual JSON editing for safety and validation!

### Step 1.3: Enhanced Memory System (Official + Custom)

**What it does**: Enhances official CLAUDE.md with @imports and PROJECT_INDEX.json integration.

**Implementation**:

1. **Enhance CLAUDE.md** with official @imports and custom references:
   ```markdown
   # Project: [Your Project Name]
   
   ## Context Imports (Official @import feature)
   @README.md
   @package.json
   @PROJECT_INDEX.json  # Custom addition
   @~/.claude/personal-preferences.md
   
   ## Quick Reference Commands
   - Build: `npm run build` or `python -m build`
   - Test: `npm test` or `pytest`
   - Lint: `npm run lint` or `flake8`
   - Start: `npm start` or `python main.py`
   
   ## Architecture Patterns
   - Use async/await for API calls
   - Follow repository pattern for data access
   - Use dependency injection for services
   - Prefer composition over inheritance
   
   ## Code Style Conventions
   - Use TypeScript for all new JavaScript code
   - Follow PEP 8 for Python code
   - Use descriptive variable names
   - Maximum function length: 50 lines
   
   ## Development Workflow
   - Always use Plan Mode for complex changes: `claude --permission-mode plan`
   - Use `/cost` to monitor context usage (stay under 70%)
   - Use `--continue` to resume sessions
   - Reference @PROJECT_INDEX.json before creating new functionality
   
   ## Extended Thinking Usage
   - `think` for routine analysis (4K tokens)
   - `think harder` for complex problems (16K tokens) 
   - `ultra think` for initial research (32K tokens)
   ```

3. **Add memory shortcuts**: Use the `#` shortcut to quickly add memories:
   ```bash
   > # Always use async/await for database operations
   ```

### Step 1.4: Plan Mode Setup (Official Feature)

**What it does**: Establishes safe exploration patterns using official Plan Mode.

**Implementation**:

1. **Test Plan Mode for safe exploration**:
   ```bash
   # Start in Plan Mode
   claude --permission-mode plan
   
   > Analyze the codebase architecture and suggest improvements
   # Claude explores safely without making changes
   
   # Exit when ready to implement
   > [Use Shift+Tab twice to exit plan mode]
   ```

2. **Configure Plan Mode as default** (optional):
   ```json
   // .claude/settings.json
   {
     "permissions": {
       "defaultMode": "plan"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Test @file references**:
   ```bash
   > Review @src/auth/login.py for security patterns
   > Compare @package.json dependencies with @requirements.txt
   ```

## Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] Official commands (`/init`, `/hooks`) working correctly
- [ ] Plan Mode functional for safe exploration
- [ ] PROJECT_INDEX.json generates automatically via hooks (custom)
- [ ] CLAUDE.md loads with @imports on session start
- [ ] Session continuity with `--continue` and `--resume`
- [ ] Extended thinking keywords available
- [ ] Team can use official features enhanced with custom additions

# Phase 2: Subagent Architecture (Week 2)
*"Official Agents + Custom Patterns"*

## Objectives
✅ Create subagents via `/agents` command  
✅ Implement blind validation pattern (custom)  
✅ Configure automatic delegation  
✅ Set up team sharing

### Step 2.1: Official Subagent Creation

**Use Official `/agents` Command**: The recommended approach for creating and managing subagents.

1. **Create code-reviewer subagent via official interface**:
   ```bash
   claude
   > /agents
   ```
   
   Select "Create New Agent" and configure (note: tools as comma-separated string):
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: code-reviewer
   description: Expert code review specialist. Use proactively after writing or modifying code to ensure quality and security.
   tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
   ---
   
   You are a senior software engineer specializing in code review and quality assurance.
   
   When reviewing code:
   1. Check @PROJECT_INDEX.json for existing patterns first
   2. Run `git diff` to see recent changes
   3. Focus on modified files and their impact
   4. Begin review immediately without asking
   
   Review checklist:
   - Code readability and maintainability
   - Security vulnerabilities and input validation
   - Performance implications
   - Test coverage adequacy
   - Architecture pattern consistency
   - No hardcoded secrets or credentials
   - Proper error handling
   
   Always reference @PROJECT_INDEX.json to understand existing patterns.
   
   Provide feedback in priority order:
   - 🔴 Critical (security, bugs): Must fix immediately
   - 🟡 Important (maintainability): Should address soon
   - 🔵 Suggestion (optimization): Consider for future
   
   Include specific examples and code snippets for fixes.
   ```

2. **Create blind validator subagent** (Custom Pattern):
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: validator
   description: Independent verification specialist. MUST BE USED for final validation. Has NO development context.
   tools: Bash, Read, Grep
   ---
   
   You are an independent QA specialist with NO knowledge of the development process.
   Your job is to verify that features work as specified in the original requirements.
   
   Validation process:
   1. Read the original requirements carefully
   2. Test the feature from a user perspective  
   3. Run automated tests if available
   4. Check edge cases and error conditions
   5. Provide clear pass/fail determination
   
   You must:
   - Test functionality, not code quality
   - Verify actual behavior against requirements
   - Document any discrepancies found
   - Provide evidence for your conclusions
   - Give a clear PASS or FAIL verdict
   
   Do not accept "it should work" - verify it actually works.
   ```

3. **Create debugger subagent**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: debugger  
   description: Bug investigation specialist. Use proactively when encountering errors, failures, or unexpected behavior.
   tools: Read, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
   ---
   
   You are an expert debugging specialist focused on root cause analysis.
   
   Debugging methodology:
   1. Capture complete error information (stack trace, logs, environment)
   2. Reproduce the issue reliably
   3. Form hypotheses about root causes
   4. Test hypotheses systematically
   5. Identify the minimal fix that addresses the root cause
   6. Verify the fix resolves the issue
   
   Always:
   - Focus on root causes, not symptoms
   - Add strategic logging to understand program state
   - Consider race conditions and timing issues
   - Check recent changes that might have introduced the bug
   - Verify fixes don't break existing functionality
   
   Document your investigation process and findings.
   ```

4. **Create test-runner subagent**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: test-runner
   description: Automated testing specialist. Use proactively to run tests and fix failures. Ensures comprehensive test coverage.
   tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit
   ---
   
   You are a testing automation expert focused on comprehensive validation.
   
   Testing workflow:
   1. Identify appropriate test commands from @CLAUDE.md
   2. Run existing tests and report results
   3. If tests fail, investigate and fix issues
   4. For new features, create appropriate test cases
   5. Ensure test coverage meets project standards
   
   Test strategy priorities:
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for API endpoints  
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Performance tests for optimization
   
   Always run tests after fixes to ensure nothing breaks.
   ```

### Step 2.2: Configure Subagent Permissions (Official)

**Use Official `/permissions` Command**: Configure tool access properly.

1. **Set subagent permissions**:
   ```bash
   > /permissions
   ```
   Configure rules for subagent tool access if needed.

### Step 2.3: Create Additional Specialized Subagents

1. **Create architect subagent** for system design:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: architect
   description: System design specialist. Use for planning complex features, migrations, or architectural decisions.
   tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Write
   ---
   
   You are a senior software architect specializing in system design and technical planning.
   
   When planning features or migrations:
   1. Analyze @PROJECT_INDEX.json to understand existing architecture
   2. Identify affected components and dependencies
   3. Design solutions that fit existing patterns
   4. Consider scalability, security, and maintainability
   5. Create detailed implementation plans
   6. Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
   
   Always prioritize:
   - Consistency with existing patterns
   - Minimal breaking changes
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Testable design
   - Performance implications
   
   Provide detailed implementation plans with file structures and interfaces.
   ```

2. **Set up team sharing** (Official Directory Structure):
   ```bash
   # Subagents created in .claude/agents/ are automatically shared
   # when you use /agents and select "Project" storage
   git add .claude/agents/
   git commit -m "Add shared subagents for team"
   ```

### Step 2.4: Subagent Usage Patterns (Official + Custom)

**Official Automatic Delegation**: Claude automatically delegates based on task descriptions.

1. **Automatic delegation examples** (Official Behavior):
   ```bash
   > review my recent changes for security issues
   # Automatically uses code-reviewer subagent
   
   > there's a bug where users can't login - investigate
   # Automatically uses debugger subagent
   
   > run all tests and fix any failures  
   # Automatically uses test-runner subagent
   ```

2. **Explicit subagent invocation** (When automatic doesn't work):
   ```bash
   > use the validator subagent to verify the login feature works
   > have the architect subagent design the user profile system
   > ask the code-reviewer subagent to check the payment module
   ```

3. **Blind validation pattern** (Our Custom Pattern):
   ```bash
   > I've completed the notification system. Use the validator subagent to independently verify it works according to the original requirements.
   ```

## Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] Subagents created successfully via `/agents` command
- [ ] Automatic delegation working based on descriptions
- [ ] Blind validator provides independent verification (custom pattern)
- [ ] Tool permissions configured correctly via `/permissions`
- [ ] Team sharing functional via `.claude/agents/` directory
- [ ] Subagents have proper context isolation

# Phase 3: Advanced Automation (Week 3)
*"Streamlined Operations"*

## Objectives
✅ Implement custom slash commands  
✅ Set up advanced hook workflows  
✅ Create session management automation  
✅ Establish validation pipelines

### Step 3.1: Essential Slash Commands

**From Official Best Practices**: Custom commands with $ARGUMENTS support.

1. **Create `/cleanup` command** - Session cleanup automation:

   `.claude/commands/cleanup.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Clean up current session and prepare for next phase
   argument-hint: [next phase description]
   ---
   
   Perform session cleanup and preparation:
   
   1. Update all documentation files based on current progress
   2. Update PROJECT_INDEX.json if files were modified
   3. Summarize completed work and current status
   4. Plan next phase: $ARGUMENTS
   5. Save comprehensive session state to files
   
   Document findings in appropriate files for session continuity.
   ```

2. **Create `/fresh` command** - Fresh session initialization:

   `.claude/commands/fresh.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Initialize fresh session with full project context
   ---
   
   Initialize new session with complete project awareness:
   
   1. Read @PROJECT_INDEX.json to understand project structure  
   2. Read @CLAUDE.md for project conventions and memory
   3. Check @README.md for project overview
   4. Review recent git commits for context: `git log --oneline -10`
   5. Check current status: `git status`
   6. Load any session state files from previous session
   
   Provide a brief summary of project status and readiness to continue work.
   ```

3. **Create `/validate` command** - Manual validation trigger:

   `.claude/commands/validate.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Trigger comprehensive validation of recent work
   argument-hint: [feature or area to validate]
   ---
   
   Perform comprehensive validation of: $ARGUMENTS
   
   1. Use the validator subagent for independent verification
   2. Run all relevant tests via test-runner subagent  
   3. Check code quality via code-reviewer subagent
   4. Generate validation report with evidence
   5. Identify any issues requiring fixes
   
   Provide clear PASS/FAIL status with supporting evidence.
   ```

4. **Create `/optimize` command** - Performance optimization workflow:

   `.claude/commands/optimize.md`:
   ```markdown  
   ---
   description: Analyze and optimize code for performance

### Step 3.2: Advanced Hook Workflows

**From Official Best Practices**: Comprehensive hook patterns.

1. **Pre-commit validation hook**:

   `.claude/hooks/pre-commit-validator.py`:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   """
   Pre-commit validation hook for Claude Code
   Validates code quality before commits

       except Exception as e:
           return False, "", str(e)
   
   def validate_commit():
       """Validate staged changes before commit"""
       issues = []
       
       # Check for common issues
       success, stdout, stderr = run_command("git diff --cached --name-only")
       if not success:
           return ["Could not get staged files"]
       
       staged_files = stdout.strip().split('\n') if stdout.strip() else []
       
       for file in staged_files:

                   sys.exit(2)  # Block the commit
               else:
                   print("✅ Pre-commit validation passed")
       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Pre-commit hook error: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
   ```

2. **Session state manager**:

   `.claude/hooks/session-state-manager.py`:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   """
   Session state management for Claude Code
   Saves and restores session context
   """
   import json
   import sys
   import os

           }
       }
       
       # Save to .claude directory
       os.makedirs('.claude/state', exist_ok=True)
       with open('.claude/state/last_session.json', 'w') as f:
           json.dump(state, f, indent=2)
       
       print("💾 Session state saved for continuity")
   
   def load_session_state():
       """Load previous session state"""
       try:
           with open('.claude/state/last_session.json', 'r') as f:
               state = json.load(f)
           return state
       except FileNotFoundError:
           return None
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       try:

       except Exception as e:
           print(f"Session state error: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
   ```

3. **Configure advanced hooks** in settings:
   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "PreToolUse": [
         {
           "matcher": "Bash",
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "python \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/pre-commit-validator.py\""
             }
           ]
         }
       ],
       "SessionEnd": [
         {
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command", 
               "command": "python \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/session-state-manager.py\""
             }
           ]
         }
       ],
       "SessionStart": [
         {
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "python \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/session-state-manager.py\""
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 3.3: Context Optimization Workflows

**From Expert Insights**: Strategic context management.

1. **Implement cleanup → clear → fresh sequence**:
   ```bash
   > /cleanup "implement user authentication system"  
   > /clear
   > /fresh
   ```

2. **Context monitoring workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Check context usage periodically
   > how much of my context window am I using?
   
   # When approaching 70%, initiate cleanup
   > /cleanup "switch to payment system implementation"
   ```

3. **Progressive disclosure pattern**:
   ```bash
   # Start broad
   > analyze the authentication system architecture
   
   # Narrow down  
   > focus on the login validation logic
   
   # Specific implementation
   > implement password strength validation
   ```

## Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Custom commands execute reliably
- [ ] Hooks provide automated validation  
- [ ] Session transitions preserve context
- [ ] Validation pipelines working
- [ ] Team adoption of new workflows

# Phase 4: Optimization & Scale (Week 4)  
*"Performance Excellence"*

## Objectives
✅ Implement monitoring and analytics  
✅ Optimize for team collaboration  
✅ Create advanced validation strategies  
✅ Establish best practices documentation

### Step 4.1: Performance Monitoring

1. **Create context usage tracker**:

   `.claude/commands/stats.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Show context usage and performance statistics
   ---
   
   Analyze current session performance:
   
   1. Estimate current context usage percentage
   2. Count tokens used in thinking modes
   3. Report hook execution statistics  
   4. Show subagent usage patterns
   5. Identify optimization opportunities
   
   Provide recommendations for context optimization.
   ```

2. **Token consumption analytics**:
   
   `.claude/hooks/token-tracker.py`:
   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   """Track token usage patterns for optimization"""
   import json
   import sys
   import os
   from datetime import datetime
   
   def log_token_usage(tool_data):
       """Log tool usage for analytics"""
       log_entry = {
           'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
           'tool_name': tool_data.get('tool_name'),
           'session_id': tool_data.get('session_id'),
           'hook_event': tool_data.get('hook_event_name')
       }
       
       # Append to usage log
       os.makedirs('.claude/analytics', exist_ok=True)
       with open('.claude/analytics/usage.jsonl', 'a') as f:
           f.write(json.dumps(log_entry) + '\n')
   
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       try:
           input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)
           log_token_usage(input_data)
       except Exception as e:
           pass  # Silent failure for analytics
   ```

### Step 4.2: Team Collaboration Features

**From Official Best Practices**: Sharing configurations and workflows.

1. **Create team templates**:
   
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .claude/templates
   ```

   `.claude/templates/feature-workflow.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Feature Development Workflow Template
   
   ## Phase 1: Planning
   1. Use architect subagent to design the feature
   2. Review @PROJECT_INDEX.json for existing patterns
   3. Create implementation plan
   
   ## Phase 2: Implementation  
   1. Implement core functionality
   2. Use code-reviewer subagent for quality checks
   3. Update PROJECT_INDEX.json automatically via hooks
   
   ## Phase 3: Testing
   1. Use test-runner subagent for test creation
   2. Run validation via validator subagent
   3. Performance testing if needed
   
   ## Phase 4: Integration
   1. Create pull request with /pr command
   2. Address review feedback
   3. Final validation before merge
   ```

2. **Shared subagent definitions** (commit to version control):
   ```bash
   # Ensure .claude/agents/ is tracked in git
   git add .claude/agents/
   git commit -m "Add shared subagent definitions for team"
   ```

3. **Team memory sharing**:
   ```markdown
   # In CLAUDE.md - Team Conventions
   
   ## Development Workflow
   - Always use /fresh when starting new sessions
   - Run /validate before creating pull requests  
   - Use /cleanup between major feature work
   - Reference @PROJECT_INDEX.json before creating new functionality
   
   ## Subagent Usage Patterns
   - code-reviewer: After any significant code changes
   - validator: Before claiming tasks complete
   - architect: For complex feature planning
   - debugger: When investigating issues
   
   ## Quality Gates
   - All code must pass automated validation
   - Test coverage minimum: 80%
   - Performance regression threshold: 10%
   - Security review required for auth/payment code
   ```

### Step 4.3: Advanced Validation Strategies

**From Expert Insights**: Multiple validation approaches.

1. **Visual validation subagent** for UI features:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: ui-validator
   description: Visual and user interface validation specialist. Use for frontend features and user experience validation.
   tools: Bash, Read
   ---
   
   You are a UI/UX validation specialist focused on user interface testing.
   
   Validation approach:
   1. Take screenshots of UI changes using browser automation
   2. Compare with design specifications
   3. Test responsive behavior across screen sizes
   4. Validate accessibility compliance
   5. Check cross-browser compatibility
   6. Test user interaction flows
   
   Use tools like Puppeteer or Playwright for automated testing.
   Provide visual evidence for all validation results.
   ```

2. **Performance validation workflows**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: perf-validator  
   description: Performance validation specialist. Use for performance-critical features and optimization validation.
   tools: Bash, Read, Write
   ---
   
   You are a performance testing specialist focused on benchmarking and optimization validation.
   
   Performance testing process:
   1. Establish baseline performance metrics
   2. Run load tests and stress tests
   3. Profile memory and CPU usage
   4. Measure response times and throughput
   5. Compare against performance requirements
   6. Generate detailed performance reports
   
   Tools: Apache Bench, k6, profiling tools specific to the language/platform.
   ```

3. **Security validation patterns**:
   ```bash
   > use the code-reviewer subagent to specifically check for security vulnerabilities in the authentication module
   > run security validation focusing on input sanitization and SQL injection prevention
   ```

### Step 4.4: Documentation & Knowledge Management

1. **Auto-generate workflow documentation**:
   
   `.claude/commands/document.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   description: Generate comprehensive documentation for current work
   argument-hint: [area to document]
   ---
   
   Generate comprehensive documentation for: $ARGUMENTS
   
   1. Analyze implemented features and functionality
   2. Document API interfaces and contracts
   3. Create usage examples and code snippets  
   4. Generate architecture diagrams if applicable
   5. Update README and related documentation
   6. Ensure documentation follows project standards
   
   Focus on developer onboarding and maintainability.
   ```

2. **Create troubleshooting guides**:
   
   Create `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Claude Code Enhancement System Troubleshooting
   
   ## Common Issues
   
   ### PROJECT_INDEX.json not updating
   **Symptoms**: Claude creates duplicate code despite existing functionality
   
   **Solutions**:
   1. Check hook configuration: `/hooks`
   2. Manually regenerate: `python .claude/hooks/project-indexer.py`
   3. Verify file permissions on script
   
   ### Subagents not spawning correctly  
   **Symptoms**: Tasks not delegated to appropriate subagents
   
   **Solutions**:
   1. Check subagent definitions: `/agents`
   2. Verify tool permissions are correct
   3. Use explicit invocation: "use the X subagent to..."
   
   ### Context degradation despite following guidelines
   **Symptoms**: Quality drops even under 70% context usage
   
   **Solutions**:  
   1. Use /cleanup and /clear more aggressively
   2. Check for context pollution from verbose outputs
   3. Optimize memory files for conciseness
   
   ### Hooks failing to execute
   **Symptoms**: Automation not working, manual processes required
   
   **Solutions**:
   1. Check script permissions: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.py`
   2. Verify Python path and dependencies
   3. Test hooks manually: `python .claude/hooks/script.py < test-input.json`
   ```

## Phase 4 Success Criteria  
- [ ] Monitoring and analytics functional
- [ ] Team collaboration workflows established
- [ ] Advanced validation strategies implemented
- [ ] Documentation complete and accessible
- [ ] Success metrics being tracked

# 🎯 Daily Usage Patterns

## Morning Routine - Fresh Session Start
```bash
claude
> /fresh
> think about today's development priorities based on project status
```

## Feature Development Cycle
```bash
# Planning phase  
> use the architect subagent to design the user notification system

# Implementation phase
> implement the notification service based on the architectural plan
> update the API endpoints for notification management

# Quality assurance phase  
> use the code-reviewer subagent to review the notification system
> use the test-runner subagent to create comprehensive tests

# Validation phase
> use the validator subagent to verify the notification system works correctly
> /validate notification system

# Completion phase
> /cleanup "move to user dashboard implementation"
```

## End of Day Routine
```bash
> /cleanup "continue with dashboard implementation tomorrow"  
> commit all changes with descriptive messages
> /clear
```

## Emergency Debugging Session
```bash
> there's a critical bug in production - users can't complete checkout
> use the debugger subagent to investigate this immediately
> once fixed, use the validator subagent to verify the fix works
```

# 🚀 Best Practices Summary

## From Official Documentation

### Context Management
- **Reference files efficiently**: Use `@filename` instead of asking Claude to search
- **Progressive disclosure**: Start broad ("analyze the auth system"), then narrow down
- **Use Plan Mode** for exploration: `claude --permission-mode plan`
- **Leverage subagents** for focused tasks with isolated contexts

### Workflow Optimization  
- **Be specific with requests**: "Fix the login bug where users see blank screen" vs "fix the bug"
- **Use step-by-step instructions** for complex tasks
- **Let Claude explore first** before making changes
- **Combine multiple techniques**: thinking modes + subagents + file references

### Quality Assurance
- **Always close the loop with testing**: Define test plans upfront
- **Use specialized subagents** for code review and validation
- **Implement blind validation**: Independent verification of completion claims
- **Automate quality checks**: Hooks for formatting, validation, testing

## From Expert Insights

### Strategic Principles
- **Context is sacred workspace**: Never exceed 70% usage for quality maintenance
- **Trust but verify**: "I love Claude, but I don't trust Claude" - always validate
- **Be the architect**: Spend 60-70% time planning and reviewing, not just coding
- **Miller's Law applies**: Limit to 5-7 chunks of information simultaneously

### Technical Patterns
- **PROJECT_INDEX.json is critical**: Prevents duplicate code creation in large projects
- **Blind validation prevents false completion**: Separate agent verifies without development context
- **Subagent orchestration maximizes efficiency**: Up to 10 parallel agents with fresh contexts
- **Strategic thinking mode usage**: Ultra think for complex problems, regular think for routine tasks

### Session Management
- **Cleanup → Clear → Fresh sequence**: Optimal session transition pattern
- **File-based context preservation**: Write summaries and state to files before clearing
- **Memory hierarchy utilization**: Enterprise → Project → User → Local memory levels
- **Hook automation**: Invisible background processes that don't consume context

/cleanup "next phase"    # Clean session and plan next phase
/clear                   # Clear conversation history

# Project awareness
@PROJECT_INDEX.json      # Reference project structure
@CLAUDE.md              # Reference project conventions
@filename               # Include specific file content

# Quality assurance
/validate               # Trigger comprehensive validation
> use the code-reviewer subagent to check recent changes
> use the validator subagent to verify the feature works

# Specialized tasks

```

## Thinking Mode Strategy
```bash
> think                 # 4K tokens - routine tasks
> think hard           # 8K tokens - focused analysis  
> think harder         # 16K tokens - complex problems
> ultra think          # 32K tokens - initial research, difficult problems
```

## Subagent Invocation Patterns
```bash
# Automatic (recommended)
> review my code for security issues
> debug this login problem  
> run all tests and fix failures

# Explicit (when automatic doesn't work)
> use the code-reviewer subagent to check the payment module
> have the architect subagent design the user profile system
> ask the debugger subagent to investigate the performance issue
```
