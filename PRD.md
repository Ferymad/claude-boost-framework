# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Claude Code Performance Enhancement System (CCPES) v2.0

**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Aligned with Official Claude Code Documentation

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD defines the implementation of a comprehensive performance enhancement system for Claude Code, combining official capabilities with innovative extensions based on expert insights. The system leverages built-in features while adding custom solutions for enterprise-grade development workflows.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Current Claude Code usage patterns suffer from:

- **Context Degradation**: Quality drops significantly after 50% context usage, not just at 90%
- **Code Duplication Crisis**: Without project awareness, Claude creates duplicate functionality instead of refactoring existing code
- **False Completion Claims**: Models mark tasks complete without verification (~40% accuracy)
- **Token Waste**: Inefficient thinking mode usage burns context unnecessarily 
- **Session Discontinuity**: Loss of context between sessions disrupts workflow continuity
- **Lack of Project Awareness**: Claude doesn't understand full codebase structure, leading to poor architectural decisions

### 1.3 Solution Overview
A multi-layered enhancement system combining official features with custom innovations:

#### **Official Claude Code Features Enhanced**:
1. **Subagent Architecture**: Task-specific agents via `/agents` command with custom validation patterns
2. **Hook System**: Automated workflows via `/hooks` command with advanced triggers
3. **Memory Management**: CLAUDE.md with @file imports and hierarchical loading
4. **Plan Mode**: Safe exploration with `--permission-mode plan`
5. **Session Continuity**: Enhanced `--continue`/`--resume` with deep state preservation

#### **Custom Innovations**:
1. **PROJECT_INDEX.json System**: Minified codebase abstractions preventing code duplication
2. **Blind Validation Pattern**: Independent verification using subagents creatively
3. **70% Context Rule**: Proactive quality maintenance threshold
4. **Advanced Session State**: Deep context preservation beyond official capabilities
