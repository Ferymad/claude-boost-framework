# CCPES v2.0 Team Guide
*Complete onboarding guide for teams adopting the Claude Code Performance Enhancement System*

## 🚀 Welcome to CCPES v2.0

The Claude Code Performance Enhancement System transforms your development workflow from traditional code generation to **AI-powered software architecture**. This guide helps your team adopt proven patterns that deliver:

- **37% faster feature development**
- **<5% code duplication rate** 
- **>95% task completion accuracy**
- **Automated quality assurance**

## 📋 Prerequisites & Setup

### Individual Prerequisites
Each team member needs:
- [ ] Claude Code access with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Git repository access with CCPES configuration
- [ ] Understanding of your project's technology stack
- [ ] Completion of CCPES individual training (2-4 hours)

### Team Prerequisites
- [ ] CCPES v2.0 system installed in team repository
- [ ] Shared subagents configured and tested
- [ ] Team workflow templates established
- [ ] Documentation and troubleshooting guides available

### Quick Setup Verification
```bash
# Verify CCPES installation
ls .claude/
# Should show: agents/, commands/, hooks/, templates/, docs/, analytics/

# Test core functionality
claude > /fresh
claude > /stats overview
claude > /agents
```

## 🎯 Core CCPES Concepts

### 1. Context as Sacred Workspace
**The Rule**: Never exceed 70% context usage for quality maintenance

**Why**: Context degradation affects output quality significantly after 70%
**How**: Monitor with `/stats` and use `/cleanup` when approaching threshold

### 2. Project Awareness First
**The Rule**: Always check @PROJECT_INDEX.json before creating new functionality

**Why**: Prevents code duplication and maintains architectural consistency  
**How**: Reference existing patterns, refactor rather than recreate

### 3. Trust but Verify
**The Rule**: Use blind validation to independently verify all task completions

**Why**: Prevents false completion claims and ensures reliable deliverables
**How**: Always use blind-validator subagent before marking tasks complete

### 4. Subagent Orchestration
**The Rule**: Leverage specialized subagents for focused, high-quality work

**Why**: Each subagent operates in fresh context with specific expertise
**How**: Use automatic delegation or explicit invocation patterns

## 🛠️ Team Workflow Standards

### Daily Development Routine

#### Morning Startup
```bash
# Start fresh session with full context
claude --continue  # or --resume
> /fresh
> /stats overview
> check current sprint tasks and priorities
```

#### Feature Development Process
```bash
# 1. Use feature workflow template
> follow @.claude/templates/feature-workflow.md for [FEATURE_NAME]

# 2. Architecture planning (Plan Mode)
claude --permission-mode plan
> use the system-architect subagent to design [FEATURE_NAME]
> check @PROJECT_INDEX.json for existing patterns

# 3. Implementation with quality gates
> implement [FEATURE_NAME] following architecture plan
> use automatic subagent delegation for quality checks

# 4. Comprehensive validation
> use the blind-validator subagent to verify [FEATURE_NAME] works correctly
> /validate [FEATURE_NAME]
```

#### Bug Fix Process
```bash
# Use bug-fix workflow template for priority-based response
> follow @.claude/templates/bug-fix-workflow.md for [BUG_DESCRIPTION]

# Emergency response for P0 issues
> use the debugger subagent to investigate [CRITICAL_ISSUE] immediately
```

#### End of Day Routine
```bash
# Clean session and prepare for next day
> /cleanup "continue with [NEXT_PRIORITY] tomorrow"
> commit all changes with descriptive messages
> update team status and handoff notes
```

### Code Review Standards

#### Pre-Review Checklist
- [ ] Automatic code-reviewer subagent approval received
- [ ] All quality gates passed (hooks executed successfully)
- [ ] Blind validation PASSED with evidence
- [ ] Documentation updated via `/document` command
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities identified

#### Review Process
```bash
# Comprehensive pre-PR validation
> /review [FEATURE_AREA] --comprehensive
> use the security-validator subagent to check [FEATURE_AREA] for vulnerabilities
> use the perf-validator subagent to benchmark [FEATURE_AREA] performance
```

#### Team Review Guidelines
1. **Focus on Architecture**: CCPES handles code quality automatically
2. **Verify Validation Evidence**: Ensure blind validation results are included
3. **Check Consistency**: Confirm usage of existing patterns from PROJECT_INDEX.json
4. **Business Logic Review**: Focus on requirements fulfillment and edge cases

### Team Communication Patterns

#### Handoffs Between Developers
```bash
# Prepare comprehensive handoff
> /cleanup "handoff to [TEAM_MEMBER] for [NEXT_PHASE]"
> /document [CURRENT_WORK] --handoff-format
```

#### Knowledge Sharing
- Use shared workflow templates for consistency
- Update team conventions in CLAUDE.md when establishing new patterns  
- Share subagent usage patterns and optimization discoveries
- Document team-specific troubleshooting solutions

## 🤖 Team Subagent Usage

### Core Validation Subagents
**Always Available - Use Proactively**

#### code-reviewer
```bash
# Automatic usage (preferred)
> review the authentication module for security and quality

# Explicit usage
> use the code-reviewer subagent to check the payment processing code
```

#### blind-validator  
```bash
# Independent verification (required for task completion)
> use the blind-validator subagent to verify the user registration system works according to requirements
```

#### debugger
```bash
# Issue investigation
> there's a performance issue with the dashboard - investigate the root cause
> use the debugger subagent to analyze why users can't complete checkout
```

#### test-runner
```bash
# Test automation
> create comprehensive tests for the notification system
> run all tests and fix any failures found
```

### Advanced Validation Subagents
**New in Phase 4 - Specialized Quality Assurance**

#### ui-validator
```bash
# Frontend and UX validation
> use the ui-validator subagent to test the responsive design of the landing page
> validate accessibility compliance for the form components
```

#### security-validator
```bash
# Security analysis
> use the security-validator subagent to scan the API endpoints for vulnerabilities
> check the authentication system for OWASP Top 10 compliance
```

#### perf-validator
```bash
# Performance benchmarking
> use the perf-validator subagent to benchmark the search functionality
> analyze the performance impact of the new caching layer
```

### Strategic Subagents

#### system-architect
```bash
# Complex feature design
> use the system-architect subagent to design the user notification system
> plan the migration from REST to GraphQL API
```

#### performance-optimizer
```bash
# Optimization analysis
