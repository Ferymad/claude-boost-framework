### Context Usage Analysis

#### Key Performance Indicators
- **Average Session Usage**: Target <70%, Optimal <60%
- **Peak Usage Patterns**: Identify high-consumption activities
- **Efficiency Score**: Quality output per context percentage used
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Activities for context reduction

#### Measurement Methodology
```bash
# Context usage estimation formula
Context Usage = (Tool Operations √ó 0.4) + (Subagent Contexts √ó 0.3) + 
                (File References √ó 0.2) + (Conversation √ó 0.1)

# Efficiency calculation
Context Efficiency = Tasks Completed Successfully / Context Usage Percentage
```

#### Optimization Targets
- **Green Zone**: <60% usage - Optimal performance maintained
- **Yellow Zone**: 60-70% usage - Monitor closely, prepare for cleanup
- **Red Zone**: >70% usage - Immediate cleanup required

### Hook Performance Analytics

```bash
# Hook execution classification
Fast Hooks: <50ms      (PROJECT_INDEX.json updates)
Standard: 50-100ms     (Validation checks)
Slow: 100-200ms        (Complex analysis tasks)
Timeout: >200ms        (Requires optimization)
```

### Subagent Utilization Metrics

#### Usage Distribution Analysis
- **Most Active Subagents**: Frequency and success rate ranking
- **Response Time Patterns**: Average and percentile response times
- **Delegation Efficiency**: Automatic vs manual invocation rates
- **Context Isolation Success**: Independent context maintenance rates

#### Quality Assessment
```bash
# Subagent performance scoring
Performance Score = (Success Rate √ó 0.4) + (Speed Score √ó 0.3) + 
                   (Delegation Efficiency √ó 0.3)

Speed Score = max(0, (5000ms - Avg Response Time) / 5000ms) √ó 100
```

### Quality Gate Analytics

#### Validation Pipeline Success
- **Code Review Pass Rate**: Automated review success percentage
- **Security Scan Results**: Vulnerabilities detected and resolved
- **Performance Benchmark Status**: Features meeting performance targets
- **Test Coverage Achievement**: Code coverage percentage trends

#### Quality Trend Analysis
```bash
# Quality improvement calculation
Quality Trend = (Current Period Average - Previous Period Average) / 
                Previous Period Average √ó 100

# Acceptable ranges
Improving: >5% positive trend
Stable: -5% to +5% trend
Degrading: <-5% negative trend
