Perform comprehensive code review for: $ARGUMENTS

## Code Review Workflow

1. **Identify scope of review**
   - Analyze recent git changes: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1`
   - Focus on modified files or specified area
   - Check PROJECT_INDEX.json for context

2. **Use code-reviewer subagent for detailed analysis**
   - Automated quality checks and security scanning
   - Architecture pattern consistency validation
   - Performance and maintainability assessment

3. **Security and vulnerability assessment**
   - Check for hardcoded secrets or credentials
   - Validate input sanitization and validation
   - Review authentication and authorization logic
   - Assess potential injection vulnerabilities

4. **Code quality evaluation**
   - Review readability and maintainability
   - Check for proper error handling
   - Validate test coverage adequacy
   - Assess documentation completeness

5. **Architecture and design review**
   - Ensure consistency with existing patterns
   - Evaluate separation of concerns
   - Check dependency management
   - Review API design decisions

6. **Generate review report**
   - Prioritize findings: Critical ðŸ”´, Important ðŸŸ¡, Suggestions ðŸ”µ
   - Provide specific examples and recommended fixes
   - Include actionable next steps
   - Document any architectural decisions
