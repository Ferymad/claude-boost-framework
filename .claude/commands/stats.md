Display comprehensive performance and usage statistics for the current session:

## Context & Performance Analysis

1. **Context Usage Monitoring**
   - Estimate current context usage percentage
   - Track token consumption patterns
   - Identify context-heavy operations
   - Recommend optimization strategies

2. **Hook Execution Statistics**  
   - Review recent hook execution success rates
   - Check PROJECT_INDEX.json update frequency
   - Monitor hook performance metrics
   - Identify any automation failures

3. **Subagent Usage Patterns**
   - Track which subagents have been used
   - Monitor subagent spawn times and success rates
   - Analyze delegation effectiveness
   - Review context isolation performance

4. **Project Health Metrics**
   - Code duplication rate analysis from PROJECT_INDEX.json
   - Task completion accuracy tracking
   - Session continuity success rate
   - Quality improvement trends

5. **Recommendations**
   - Context optimization opportunities
   - Workflow efficiency improvements
   - Subagent usage optimization
   - Session management suggestions

## Usage Guidelines

Run this command periodically to:
- Monitor the 70% context usage threshold
- Track system performance trends
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Validate success metrics from PRD

The goal is to maintain high-quality output while staying under the 70% context threshold for optimal performance.
