## Comprehensive Analytics Generation

### 1. Context Efficiency Analysis
```bash
# Analyze current context usage
echo "=== CONTEXT USAGE ANALYSIS ==="
echo "Current Session Context: [ESTIMATE]%"
echo "70% Threshold Status: [SAFE/WARNING/CRITICAL]"
echo "Context Efficiency Score: [X/10]"
echo "Recommendations: [OPTIMIZATION_SUGGESTIONS]"
```

### 2. System Performance Metrics
```bash
# Check hook execution statistics
echo "=== SYSTEM AUTOMATION HEALTH ==="
python .claude/analytics/analyze-hook-performance.py
echo "Hook Success Rate: [X]%"
echo "PROJECT_INDEX.json Updates: [X] today"
echo "Average Hook Execution Time: [X]ms"
```

### 3. Subagent Utilization Analysis
```bash
# Analyze subagent usage patterns
echo "=== SUBAGENT PERFORMANCE ==="
echo "Most Used Subagents:"
echo "  1. code-reviewer: [X] invocations (avg: [X]s response)"
echo "  2. blind-validator: [X] invocations ([X]% success rate)"
echo "  3. debugger: [X] invocations"
echo "Delegation Efficiency: [X]% automatic vs manual"
```

### 4. Quality Metrics Dashboard
```bash
# Display quality and success metrics
echo "=== QUALITY & SUCCESS METRICS ==="
echo "Task Completion Accuracy: [X]% (Target: >95%)"
echo "Code Duplication Rate: [X]% (Target: <5%)"
echo "Validation Success Rate: [X]% (Target: >95%)"
echo "Session Continuity Rate: [X]% (Target: >80%)"
```

### 5. Productivity Insights
```bash
# Generate productivity analysis
echo "=== PRODUCTIVITY INSIGHTS ==="
echo "Feature Development Time: [X]% improvement vs baseline"
echo "Context Usage Efficiency: [X]% average per session"
echo "Hook Automation Savings: [X] manual steps automated"
echo "Quality Gate Success: [X]% first-time pass rate"
```

### 6. Performance Trends
```bash
# Show historical trends
python .claude/analytics/generate-trend-analysis.py --days 7
echo "=== 7-DAY PERFORMANCE TRENDS ==="
echo "Context Usage Trend: [IMPROVING/STABLE/DEGRADING]"
echo "Quality Metrics Trend: [IMPROVING/STABLE/DEGRADING]"
echo "Automation Reliability: [IMPROVING/STABLE/DEGRADING]"
```

### 7. Team Collaboration Metrics
```bash
# Team-specific analytics
echo "=== TEAM COLLABORATION METRICS ==="
echo "Workflow Template Usage: [X]% adoption rate"
echo "Shared Subagent Usage: [X] team invocations"
echo "Knowledge Sharing Score: [X/10]"
echo "Team Productivity Index: [X/10]"
```

### 8. Optimization Recommendations
```bash
# Intelligent recommendations engine
echo "=== OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS ==="
echo "ðŸ”¥ HIGH PRIORITY:"
echo "  â€¢ [SPECIFIC_RECOMMENDATION_1]"
echo "âš¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY:"
echo "  â€¢ [SPECIFIC_RECOMMENDATION_2]"
echo "ðŸ’¡ OPPORTUNITIES:"
echo "  â€¢ [SPECIFIC_RECOMMENDATION_3]"
```

### 9. Success Metrics Validation
```bash
# Validate against PRD success criteria
echo "=== PRD SUCCESS METRICS VALIDATION ==="
echo "âœ… Code Duplication <5%: [STATUS]"
echo "âœ… Task Accuracy >95%: [STATUS]"
echo "âœ… Context Usage <70%: [STATUS]"
echo "âœ… Hook Success >99%: [STATUS]"
echo "âœ… Team Adoption >80%: [STATUS]"
```

### 10. Interactive Analytics
```bash
# Generate interactive dashboard
python .claude/analytics/dashboard-generator.py --type $ARGUMENTS
echo "ðŸ“Š Interactive dashboard generated at: .claude/analytics/dashboard.html"
echo "ðŸ”— View in browser: file://$(pwd)/.claude/analytics/dashboard.html"
