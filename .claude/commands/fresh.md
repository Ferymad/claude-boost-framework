---

Initialize new session with complete project awareness:

1. Read @PROJECT_INDEX.json to understand project structure  
2. Read @CLAUDE.md for project conventions and memory
3. Check @README.md for project overview
4. Review recent git commits for context: `git log --oneline -10`
5. Check current status: `git status`
6. Load any session state files from previous session

Provide a brief summary of project status and readiness to continue work.
