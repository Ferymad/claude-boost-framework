## üéØ **What We're Validating**

We've built a technically sophisticated framework, but we need **real data** to validate our performance claims:

| **Claim** | **Target** | **Validation Method** |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Productivity Improvement** | 37% faster development | Timed feature implementation |
| **Code Duplication Prevention** | <5% duplication rate | PROJECT_INDEX.json analysis |
| **Task Completion Accuracy** | >95% verified completion | Blind validation testing |
| **Context Usage Efficiency** | <70% average usage | Session monitoring |
| **Session Continuity** | >80% success rate | State preservation testing |
